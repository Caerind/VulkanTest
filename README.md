# VulkanTest

My Vulkan playground ! 

Mainly to learn and improve my skills using it.  

I made some steps to faster the learning of Vulkan :
- Step 1 : Overview of Vulkan (by following the Vulkan Tutorial entirely)
- Step 2 : Theory of Vulkan (by following the Vulkan Cookbook, chapters 1 to 9)
- Step 3 : My Vulkan Wrapper
- Step 4 : Practice of Vulkan (by following Vulkan Cookbook, chapters 11 & 12, and then Vulkan Examples by SaschaWillems)
- Step 5 : Improve the wrapper and made it a rendering engine
- Step 6 : Add Vulkan to my NumeaEngine
  
  
  
Step 1 : DONE : https://github.com/Cmdu76/VulkanTest/tree/671d35ced75e39df5468d227fd8bf4cd5d28682d  
  
Step 2 : DONE : https://github.com/Cmdu76/VulkanTest/tree/e024fc0a4ebe238263637fe3a4315ead564de131  
  
Step 3 : DONE : (But there will always be improvements to made) 
  
Step 4 : DONE : (But I still need to fix the 4th example and improve all the others as possible using the new versions of the wrapper)

Step 5 : WIP
